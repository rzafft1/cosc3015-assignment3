# Search in Graphs

Recall the pseudocode for Depth-First Search:

Given a graph, a start node, and a node we're looking for:
- starting at the start node, while unvisited nodes remain
    - if current vertex $v$ is the node we're looking for, return it
    - mark $v$ as visited
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - recursively process $w$ unless marked visited

Implement the algorithm. You can choose any of the data structures we covered
(adjacency matrix or adjacency list) for the implementation. Your function
should return the list of nodes on the path from the source to the target (not
the list of nodes that you looked at during the search). Start with the template
I provided in `code.js` and test your new function. I have not provided any test
code, but you can base yours on test code from other exercises.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

- the worst case complexity is when we have to search through every edge of every node. Here, we will have to search through every possible edge of every node to get a complexity of $O(V + E)$

## Bonus

Implement and analyze breadth-first search.
